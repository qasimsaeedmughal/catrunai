# catrunai
Cat Run is a lightweight, browser-based infinite runner game that demonstrates the power of integrating Generative AI into classic arcade mechanics. Built entirely with vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, this project serves as a case study for rapid game development and dynamic content generation.
